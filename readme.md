##Meteor Cookbook  

Hi.  Welcome to the Meteor Cookbook; a FAQ and tutorial culled and curated from over 2 years of emails and discussions from the [meteor] google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.  These documents are intended for the intermediate user learning Meteor, who is accustomed to a) object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and b) relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.  The focus is on helping the user grow accustomed to functional programming using document oriented databases.
