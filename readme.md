##Meteor Cookbook  





========================================
###[Cookbook - Table of Contents](https://github.com/awatson1978/meteor-cookbook/blob/master/table-of-contents.md)   
The Meteor Cookbook is a FAQ and tutorial culled and curated from over 2 years of emails and discussions from the [meteor] google group and my experiences rolling out packages and apps.  These documents are intended for the intermediate user learning Meteor, who is accustomed to a) object-oriented frameworks and languages, such as Java and C#, and b) relational databases and data structures derived from SQL table schemas.  The focus is on helping the user grow accustomed to functional programming using document oriented databases.  

========================================
### Install the StarryNight Utility  

Eventually, there were so many scripts in the Cookbook that it made sense to start putting them into a utility.  StarryNight has dozens of bells-and-whistles that the core Meteor tool lacks... tools to help the package authoring workflow, refactoring code, installing tools, testing your app, and so forth.  Check out the [project homepage](http://starrynight.meteor.com/) to find out what all it can do.

````sh
npm install starrynight -g
````


========================================
###[Example Apps](https://github.com/awatson1978/meteor-cookbook/tree/master/examples)  
The heart of the Cookbook was always about building actual applications, and figuring out patterns and best practices for building apps.  Here you'll find many additional example apps, in addition to the ones that ship with Meteor itself.



========================================
###Clinical Meteor Track  

The Cookbook is closely associated with the Clinical Meteor Track project...  an effort to create a version of Meteor designed for biomedical, clinical, and healthcare applications.  Check out the project page to learn more, and be aware that these two projects are being run in parallel.

There are a number of example clinical apps as well.  Check these out if you're building in the biomedical or healthcare space.
